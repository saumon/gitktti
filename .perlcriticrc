# GitKtti PerlCritic Configuration
#
# This configuration file customizes PerlCritic for the GitKtti project,
# which is a collection of git-flow command-line tools written in Perl.

# Keep severity at reasonable level for git-flow tools
# Level 3 catches important issues without being overly pedantic
severity = 3
verbose = 8

# Project follows its own formatting standards that prioritize readability
# The current formatting with ## comments and indentation is consistent
# across all GitKtti scripts and should be maintained
[-CodeLayout::RequireTidyCode]

# Allow established patterns in GitKtti
[Variables::ProhibitPackageVars]
packages = App::GitKtti

# Git command tools often need complex regex patterns for branch matching
# Allow slightly longer regex without requiring /x flag
[RegularExpressions::RequireExtendedFormatting]
minimum_regex_length_to_complain_about = 20

# Scripts don't need package-scoped version variables
# Version is managed centrally in App::GitKtti module
[-Modules::RequireVersionVar]

# Allow constants defined with Readonly (preferred over 'use constant')
[ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitConstantPragma]
severity = 4

# Git-flow tools need specific comment styles for clarity
[Documentation::RequirePodSections]
severity = 2
