## 📖 Description

Git flow is a branching methodology that organizes development around two main branches:

- **`master`** : production branch containing only stable and tagged code
- **`develop`** : development branch where all new features are integrated

### Git flow principles

```mermaid
---
title: Git Flow - Overview
---
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'showCommitLabel': true, 'mainBranchName': 'master'}} }%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "v1.0.0"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id: "Init dev"

    branch feature/login
    checkout feature/login
    commit id: "Add login"
    commit id: "Fix login"

    checkout develop
    merge feature/login
    commit id: "Merge login"

    branch release/v1.1.0
    checkout release/v1.1.0
    commit id: "Prepare v1.1.0"

    checkout master
    merge release/v1.1.0
    commit id: "v1.1.0" tag: "v1.1.0"

    checkout develop
    merge release/v1.1.0

    checkout master
    branch hotfix/v1.1.1
    checkout hotfix/v1.1.1
    commit id: "Fix critical bug"

    checkout master
    merge hotfix/v1.1.1
    commit id: "v1.1.1" tag: "v1.1.1"

    checkout develop
    merge hotfix/v1.1.1
```

### Branch types

- **`feature/*`** : development of new features (branched from `develop`)
- **`release/*`** : preparation of a new version (branched from `develop`)
- **`hotfix/*`** : urgent fixes in production (branched from `master`)

## 🔎 Detailed workflows

### Feature workflow

Feature branches are used to develop new functionality. They are created from
`develop` and merged back into `develop` when complete.

```mermaid
---
title: Feature Workflow
---
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'showCommitLabel': true, 'mainBranchName': 'master'}} }%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "v1.0.0"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id: "Dev work"

    branch feature/new-login
    checkout feature/new-login
    commit id: "Add login form"
    commit id: "Add validation"
    commit id: "Fix styling"

    checkout develop
    commit id: "Other dev work"
    merge feature/new-login
    commit id: "Feature merged"

    checkout master
    merge develop
    commit id: "v1.1.0" tag: "v1.1.0"

    checkout develop
    commit id: "Continue dev"
```

**Commands used:**

```bash
# Create feature branch
kfeat -n feat/new-login
# or
kfix --mode feature --name new-login

# Finalize feature (merge to develop)
kfixend
```

### Hotfix workflow

Hotfix branches are used for urgent production fixes. They branch from `master`
and merge back to both `master` and `develop`.

```mermaid
---
title: Hotfix Workflow
---
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'showCommitLabel': true, 'mainBranchName': 'master'}} }%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "v1.0.0"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id: "Dev work"
    commit id: "More dev"

    checkout master
    branch hotfix/critical-bug
    checkout hotfix/critical-bug
    commit id: "Fix critical issue"
    commit id: "Add tests"

    checkout master
    merge hotfix/critical-bug
    commit id: "v1.0.1" tag: "v1.0.1"

    checkout develop
    merge hotfix/critical-bug
    commit id: "Hotfix in dev"

    checkout master
    merge develop
    commit id: "v1.1.0" tag: "v1.1.0"
```

**Commands used:**

```bash
# Create hotfix branch (from master)
kfix -n critical-bug
# or
kfix --name critical-bug

# Finalize hotfix (merge to master and develop, create tag)
kfixend
```

### Release workflow

Release branches are used to prepare a new version. They branch from `develop`,
allow for final adjustments, then merge to both `master` and `develop`.

```mermaid
---
title: Release Workflow
---
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'showCommitLabel': true, 'mainBranchName': 'master'}} }%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "v1.0.0"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id: "Feature A"
    commit id: "Feature B"
    commit id: "Feature C"

    branch release/v1.1.0
    checkout release/v1.1.0
    commit id: "Bump version"
    commit id: "Update changelog"
    commit id: "Fix minor issues"

    checkout master
    merge release/v1.1.0
    commit id: "v1.1.0" tag: "v1.1.0"

    checkout develop
    merge release/v1.1.0
    commit id: "Release merged"

    commit id: "New feature D"
```

**Commands used:**

```bash
# Create release branch (from develop)
kfix --mode release
# or
kreal
# This will propose version numbers based on last tag

# Finalize release (merge to master and develop, create tag)
kfixend
```

### Hotfix during release workflow

Special case: when a release is in progress and a hotfix is needed, the hotfix
must be merged into the release branch first.

```mermaid
---
title: Hotfix During Release
---
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'showCommitLabel': true, 'mainBranchName': 'master'}} }%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "v1.0.0"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id: "Features ready"

    branch release/v1.1.0
    checkout release/v1.1.0
    commit id: "Prepare release"

    checkout master
    branch hotfix/urgent-fix
    checkout hotfix/urgent-fix
    commit id: "Fix urgent bug"

    checkout release/v1.1.0
    merge hotfix/urgent-fix
    commit id: "Hotfix in release"

    checkout develop
    merge release/v1.1.0
    commit id: "Release + hotfix"

    checkout master
    merge release/v1.1.0
    commit id: "v1.1.0" tag: "v1.1.0"
```

**Commands used:**

```bash
# Create hotfix as usual
kfix

# When finalizing, the script will detect the release branch
# and automatically merge hotfix into release instead of develop
kfixend
```

## 📦 Installation

### From CPAN (Recommended)

```bash
# Preferred method
cpanm App::GitKtti

# Alternative
cpan App::GitKtti
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saumon/gitktti.git
cd gitktti
./install.sh
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
```

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

To properly uninstall GitKtti based on how it was installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saumon/gitktti.git
cd gitktti
./uninstall.sh
```

The uninstall script will guide you through removing GitKtti cleanly:

- **Local installation**: Simple directory removal guidance
- **System-wide**: Automatic detection and removal of installed files
- **~/perl5**: Clean removal from local Perl library
- **CPAN**: Uses `cpan -U App::GitKtti` or falls back to manual method

## ⚒️ Available Commands

After installation, the following commands are available:

- **`gitktti-checkout`** - Switch between branches safely
- **`gitktti-delete`** - Delete branches (local and remote)
- **`gitktti-fix`** - Start a hotfix branch
- **`gitktti-fixend`** - Finish a hotfix branch
- **`gitktti-move`** - Rename branches
- **`gitktti-tag`** - Create and push tags
- **`gitktti-tests`** - Run diagnostic tests

Each command supports `--help` for detailed usage information.

## 🐰 Quick Start

```bash
# Run diagnostics
gitktti-tests

# Switch branches
gitktti-checkout --filter feature

# Start a hotfix
gitktti-fix --name critical-bug

# Create a tag
gitktti-tag --name v1.2.0

# Get help for any command
gitktti-checkout --help
```

## ⭐️ Recommended aliases

For users who prefer shorter commands, you can create these aliases:

```bash
alias kfeat='gitktti-fix --mode feature'
alias kreal='gitktti-fix --mode release'
alias kprune='gitktti-fix --prune'
alias kfix='gitktti-fix'
alias kfixend='gitktti-fixend'
alias ktag='gitktti-tag'
alias kco='gitktti-checkout'
alias kmove='gitktti-move'
alias kdel='gitktti-delete'
alias ktest='gitktti-tests'
```

### Alias descriptions

| Alias | Purpose | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `kfeat` | **Create feature branch** | Creates a new feature branch from `develop`. Equivalent to `kfix --mode feature` |
| `kreal` | **Create release branch** | Creates a new release branch from `develop`. Equivalent to `kfix --mode release` |
| `kprune` | **Clean local branches** | Deletes local branches that have been merged and are no longer needed |
| `kfix` | **Create hotfix/feature branch** | Creates a new branch (hotfix from `master` by default, or feature/release with `--mode`) |
| `kfixend` | **Finalize current branch** | Merges the current branch to appropriate target(s) and creates tags if needed |
| `ktag` | **Create/manage tags** | Creates or manages version tags on the repository |
| `kco` | **Smart checkout** | Intelligent branch checkout with Git flow awareness |
| `kmove` | **Rename branch** | Renames current branch locally and remotely |
| `kdel` | **Delete branch** | Deletes a local branch and its remote counterpart safely |

### Usage examples

**With aliases (modern):**

```bash
# Start working on a new feature
kfeat --name user-authentication # Creates feature/user-authentication

# Create a hotfix for production
kfix --name critical-security-fix # Creates hotfix/critical-security-fix from master

# Prepare a new release
kreal                           # Creates release/vX.Y.Z from develop

# Finish your work
kfixend                         # Merges current branch and handles Git flow

# Clean up merged branches
kprune                          # Removes local branches that are fully merged

# Create a tag manually
ktag                            # Creates and pushes tag

# Smart branch switching
kco                             # Switches to another branch

# Rename current branch
kmove --name feature/new-name   # Renames current branch locally and remotely
kmove                           # Interactive branch renaming

# Delete a branch
kdel --name feature/old-feature # Deletes specified branch locally and remotely
kdel --force                    # Force delete with interactive selection
kdel                            # Interactive branch deletion

# Run tests
ktest                           # Run diagnostic tests
```

**Without aliases (full command names):**

```bash
# Same functionality with full command names
gitktti-fix --mode feature --name user-authentication
gitktti-fix --name critical-security-fix
gitktti-fix --mode release
gitktti-fixend
gitktti-fix --prune
gitktti-tag
gitktti-checkout
gitktti-move --name feature/new-name
gitktti-delete --name feature/old-feature
gitktti-tests
```

## 🚀 CPAN Distribution Guide

This section is for maintainers who want to upload new versions of GitKtti to CPAN.

### Prerequisites

1. **PAUSE Account**: Create an account at https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=request_id
2. **Quality Check**: Ensure your code passes all tests and quality checks

```bash
# Run quality checks
perlcritic lib/App/GitKtti.pm
perl Makefile.PL
make test
make disttest
```

### Command Line Upload

The recommended method for uploading to CPAN using the command line:

#### Step 1: Install Upload Tool

```bash
# Install CPAN::Uploader (preferred method)
cpanm CPAN::Uploader
# or
cpan CPAN::Uploader
```

#### Step 2: Configure PAUSE Credentials

```bash
# Create credentials file (one time setup)
echo "user YOUR_PAUSE_ID" > ~/.pause
echo "password YOUR_PASSWORD" >> ~/.pause
chmod 600 ~/.pause
```

Replace `YOUR_PAUSE_ID` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your actual PAUSE credentials.

#### Step 3: Prepare Distribution

```bash
# Clean and build distribution
make realclean
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make dist
```

This creates: `App-GitKtti-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`

#### Step 4: Upload to CPAN

```bash
# Upload your distribution
cpan-upload App-GitKtti-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
```

#### What Happens Next

1. **Immediate confirmation**: Command line feedback
2. **PAUSE email**: Confirmation email from PAUSE
3. **CPAN indexing**: ~15-30 minutes to appear on CPAN
4. **MetaCPAN**: Module visible on https://metacpan.org/

#### Complete Example

```bash
# Full workflow example
cd ~/work/scripts/perl/gitktti

# Quality checks
perlcritic lib/App/GitKtti.pm
make realclean
perl Makefile.PL
make test
make disttest

# Build distribution
make dist

# Upload (assuming credentials already configured)
cpan-upload App-GitKtti-2.0.0.tar.gz
```

**Note**: Only authorized maintainers with PAUSE access can upload to CPAN.
